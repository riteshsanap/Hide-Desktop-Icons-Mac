Hide Desktop icons in Mac Alfred workflow
==========================================

This workflow is made using the AppleScript found at [LifeHacker](http://lifehacker.com/hide-and-show-desktop-icons-on-os-x-with-an-automator-s-5704241) which I just added into an Alfred workflow. 

More details can be found at the post [here](http://www.best2know.info/?p=20369)

I take no credit for the Workflow, just wish to share it.
